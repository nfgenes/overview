# ðŸ§¬â›“ NFgenes (NonFungible Genes) Overview

NFgenes is a decentralized science (DeSci) project aiming to bring data and collaboration for human genome research to the blockchain. Share knowledge, create value, build a community and teach science.

## Roadmap
![NFgenes Roadmap](https://github.com/nfgenes/overview/blob/main/nfgenes_roadmap.svg)

### Phase 1: Genesis Mint
- identify the initial list of ~20,213 unique human genes and save a keyed json file of the list to IPFS. The information for each gene entry in the list will contain the base set of data for each NFgene.

- design a decentralized, updatable and readable storage solution for all human gene related data (DNA, RNA and protein level)

- publish long term project roadmap and begin applying for grants

- identify and compile a list of labs, researchers & foundations to airdrop genesis mint NFTs to

### Phase 2: Built a web3 user interface to facilitate advanced research and query capabilities
- build a web3 front end user interface to allow advanced query capabilities and data harvesting.

- Anticipated users expected to be considered 'power users' who will be consuming large amounts of data and need ability to query entire gene database.

- a small fee per query will be charged, along the lines of something between $0.35 - $0.85 per query, with the aim to keep query fee below $1.00

- Query fees will be used to fund further UI improvements and pay royalties back to NFgene holders and NFgene DAO

### Phase 3
- create a DAO that provides exclusive access to genesis mint holders

- enables decentralized governance of the NFgene ecosystem to
    - promote the sharing of human genome data
    - create value for the scientific community
    - build a community that promotes education through NFTs

- assign a multi-sig wallet to the DAO that enables governance
    - controls all NFgene project contracts
    - enables a peer review process for data integrity
    - controls any funding received from royalties or grants
    - approves commission of new NFgene projects
    - approves distribution of DAO funs for grants & bounties

### Phase 4
- incentivise collaborations with artists to create representations of:
     - Proteins
        - 3D models of single proteins
        - protein complexes (protein-protein interactions)
        - functions
        - dysfunctions (mutation effects)
     - DNA - RNA - protein interactions

- develop a royalty model that compensates artists and provides revenue for NFgene DAO to offer bounties and commission more projects
